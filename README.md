# Maps creation from satellite imagery
### Fade Out Software
#### The project involves developing a platform called WASDI that helps experts in Earth Observation (EO) process satellite imagery on the cloud. The platform is targeted at experts in Remote Sensing and features several satellite-based applications. The team is working to develop new software tools that can extract images and data from the results of the analytics tools present on the platform, in order to help communicate the results of the analyses to the stakeholders involved. The project aims to ease the communication of the results of the applications so that decision makers can better understand the phenomena they are dealing with and respond quickly to questions such as flood size, building count, and wildfire location. The team is open to exploring various programming languages and frameworks to achieve their goals.
